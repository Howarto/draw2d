The Connection interface extends\r\n * {@link draw2d.shape.basic.PolyLine PolyLine}.<br>\r\n * The source and target endpoints of a connection are each defined using a {@link draw2d.layout.anchor.ConnectionAnchor ConnectionAnchor}.\r\n * These endpoints, along with any other points on the connection, are set by the connection's  {@link draw2d.layout.connection.ConnectionRouter ConnectionRouter}.\r\n * <br>\r\n * Usually every connection in a drawing has the same router instance. Connections with\r\n * common endpoints can share anchor instances as well.\r\n *\r\n * <h2>Connection Usage</h2>\r\n *\r\n * Connections are created and added just like any other figure. Unlike normal figures, you must not set the\r\n * bounds of a connection. Instead, you must provide the source and target port and let the connection router\r\n * calculate the connection's points. The connection then determines its own bounding box.<br>\r\n * <br>\r\n * A connection has a simple router by default - one that can connect the source and target anchors. But additional routers\r\n * are available and can be set on the connection. Some routers can handle constraints for the connection. Note that when\r\n * setting a routing constraint on a connection, you must first set the router which will use that constraint.<br>\r\n * <br>\r\n *\r\n * <b>TODO:<br></b>\r\n * <i>\r\n * A convenient way to share the router with all connections and to place connections above the drawing is to use a\r\n * ConnectionLayer. The layer has a connection router property which it shares with every child that's a connection.\r\n * You can update this property and easily change every connection's router at once.\r\n * </i>\r\n * <br>\r\n * <br>\r\n * <h2>Routing and Anchors</h2>\r\n * A connection always has a router and it must set at least two ports on the connection: the source and target\r\n * endpoints. By default, or when set to null, the connection's routing will be performed by an internal default router.\r\n * The ends are placed with the help of {@link draw2d.layout.anchor.ConnectionAnchor anchors}. An\r\n * {@link draw2d.layout.anchor.ConnectionAnchor anchors} is a fixed or calculated location, usually associated with some\r\n * figure. For example, the {@link draw2d.layout.anchor.ChopboxConnectionAnchor ChopboxAnchor} finds the point at which a\r\n * line going to the reference point intersects a box, such as the bounds of a figure. The reference point is either\r\n * the anchor at the opposite end, or a bendpoint or some other point nearest to the anchor.\r\n * <br>\r\n * {@img jsdoc_chopbox.gif ChopboxAnchor}\r\n * <br>\r\n * The router calculates the endpoints and any other points in the middle of the connection. It then sets the points on the\r\n * connection by calling {@link draw2d.shape.basic.PolyLine#addPoint Polyline.addPoint}. The connection's existing point list\r\n * can be reused to reduce garbage, but the points must be set on the connection anyway so that it knows about any changes made.\r\n * <br>\r\n * <h2>Adding Decorations and Children to Connections</h2>\r\n * Like most figures, Connection supports the addition of children. The children might be a label that\r\n * decorate the connection. The placement of each type of decoration can vary, so a {@link draw2d.layout.locator.ConnectionLocator ConnectionLocator}\r\n * is used to delegate to each child's constraint object, a Locator. <br>\r\n * <br>\r\n * {@link draw2d.decoration.connection.Decorator Decorator} can be used to create and render a rotatable shape at\r\n * the end or start of a connection like arrows or boxes. Examples are {@link draw2d.decoration.connection.ArrowDecorator ArrowDecorator}, {@link draw2d.decoration.connection.BarDecorator BarDecorator} or {@link draw2d.decoration.connection.CircleDecorator CircleDecorator}\r\n * <br>\r\n * <h2>Connection Layout</h2>\r\n * Connections extend the process of validation and layout to include routing. Since layout is the process of positioning children, routing must\r\n * come first. This allows a child's locator to operate on the connection's newly-routed points.<br>\r\n * Check out [Class System Guide](#!/guide/class_system) for additional reading.\r\n *\r\n * @inheritable\r\n * @author Andreas Herz\r\n * @extends draw2d.shape.basic.PolyLine\r\n */\r\n\r\nimport draw2d from 'packages'\r\nimport extend from 'util/extend'\r\n\r\n\r\ndraw2d.Connection = draw2d.shape.basic.PolyLine.extend(\r\n  /** @lends draw2d.Connection.prototype */\r\n  {\r\n\r\n  NAME: \"draw2d.Connection\",\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Creates a new figure element which are not assigned to any canvas.\r\n   *\r\n   * @param {Object} [attr] the configuration of the shape\r\n   */\r\n  init: function (attr, setter, getter) {\r\n    this.sourcePort = null\r\n    this.targetPort = null\r\n\r\n    this.oldPoint = null\r\n\r\n    this.sourceDecorator = null\r\n    /*:draw2d.ConnectionDecorator*/\r\n    this.targetDecorator = null\r\n    /*:draw2d.ConnectionDecorator*/\r\n\r\n    // decoration of the polyline\r\n    //\r\n    this.sourceDecoratorNode = null\r\n    this.targetDecoratorNode = null\r\n\r\n    // helper var to restore the initial visual representation if the user drag&drop\r\n    // the port outside of the browser window.

horizontally in a dynamic rectangular grid of cells, with each component occupying in one or more cell.\r\n * To define a form layout you specify the form's columns, rows. Everyhing that applies to columns applies\r\n * to rows too - just with a different orientation. FlexGridLayout uses the same API, algorithms and implementation\r\n * for column and rows.\r\n *\r\n * FlexGridLayout focuses on form-oriented panels much like the 'Segment' panel. Nevertheless, it is a general purpose\r\n * layout system that can be used for the vast majority of rectangular layouts.\r\n *\r\n * Define your layout with:\r\n * <ul>\r\n *  <li>[number]px</li>\r\n *  <li>grow</li>\r\n *  <li>pref</li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n *\r\n * e.g. we want build a shape with a border on the left and right and a label in the\r\n * center. We allow the center to grow, the shape is resizeable.\r\n *\r\n * <pre>\r\n *    10px       grow         10px\r\n *\r\n *    -----+------------------+-----\r\n *    |    |  [LABEL]         |    |\r\n *    |    |                  |    |\r\n *    |    |                  |    |    grow\r\n *    |    |                  |    |\r\n *    |    |                  |    |\r\n *    -----+------------------+-----\r\n * </pre>\r\n *\r\n * The number forces the exact width or height of the cell. <b>grow</b> respect the minimum width of the\r\n * element and allows to resize the shape. The row/col with the <b>grow</b> declaration will be resized.\r\n * The <b>pref</b> declaration forces the cell to the minimum width/height of the embedded figure.\r\n *\r\n * Example Implementation of a shape:\r\n *\r\n * @example\r\n *     let PredefinedProcess = draw2d.shape.layout.FlexGridLayout.extend({\r\n *\r\n *\r\n *          //     10px       grow         10px\r\n *          //\r\n *          //    -----+------------------+-----\r\n *          //    |    |  [LABEL]         |    |\r\n *          //    |    |                  |    |\r\n *          //    |    |                  |    |    grow\r\n *          //    |    |                  |    |\r\n *          //    |    |                  |    |\r\n *          //    -----+------------------+-----\r\n *          //\r\n *          // @param attr\r\n *          //\r\n *         init: function(attr, setter, getter)\r\n *         {\r\n *            this._super(extend({\r\n *                 columns:\"10px, grow, 10px\",\r\n *                 rows:   \"grow\",\r\n *                 bgColor:\"#FFFFFF\",\r\n *                 stroke:2\r\n *             },attr),\r\n *            setter,\r\n *             getter);\r\n *\r\n *\r\n *             this.label = new draw2d.shape.basic.Label({text:\"Process Name\", resizeable:true, stroke:2});\r\n *             this.label.installEditor(new draw2d.ui.LabelInplaceEditor());\r\n *             this.add(this.label, {row:0, col:1});\r\n *\r\n *             this.setDimension(120,80);\r\n *         }\r\n *     });\r\n *     let shape = new PredefinedProcess();\r\n *     canvas.add(shape,10,10);\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * @author Andreas Herz\r\n * @extends draw2d.shape.layout.Layout\r\n * @since 2.5.1\r\n */\r\nimport draw2d from '../../packages'\r\nimport extend from '../../util/extend'\r\n\r\ndraw2d.shape.layout.FlexGridLayout = draw2d.shape.layout.Layout.extend(\r\n  /** @lends draw2d.shape.layout.FlexGridLayout.prototype */\r\n  {\r\n  \r\n  NAME: \"draw2d.shape.layout.FlexGridLayout\",\r\n\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Create a new instance\r\n   *\r\n   * @param {Object} [attr] the configuration of the shape\r\n   */\r\n  init: function (attr, setter, getter) {\r\n    let _this = this\r\n    this.cellLocator = {\r\n      relocate: function (index, figure) {\r\n        if (_this.gridDef.layoutRequired === true) {\r\n          _this._layout()\r\n        }\r\n        let cell = figure.__cellConstraint\r\n        let x = cell.x\r\n        let y = cell.y\r\n\r\n        // stretch the figure to fill the complete cell\r\n        //\r\n        if (figure.isResizeable()) {\r\n          figure.setDimension(\r\n            Math.max(figure.getMinWidth(), cell.width),\r\n            Math.max(figure.getMinHeight(), cell.height))\r\n        }\r\n        // else apply the valign and align property\r\n        //\r\n        else {\r\n          // apply vertical alignment\r\n          //\r\n          switch (cell.valign) {\r\n            case \"middle\":\r\n              y = y + (cell.height - figure.getHeight()) / 2\r\n              break\r\n            case \"bottom\":\r\n              y = y + (cell.height - figure.getHeight())\r\n              break\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          // apply horizontal alignment\r\n          //\r\n          switch (cell.align) {\r\n            case \"center\":\r\n              x = x + (cell.width - figure.getWidth()) / 2\r\n              break\r\n            case \"right\":\r\n              x = x + (cell.width - figure.getWidth())\r\n              break\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        figure.setPosition(x, y)\r\n      },\r\n      bind: function () {\r\n      },\r\n      unbind: function () {\r\n      },\r\n      translate: function (figure, diff) {\r\n        figure.setPosition(figure.x + diff.x, figure.y + diff.y)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    this.debug = false\r\n    this.gridDef = {\r\n      debugLines: [],\r\n      def_cols: [],\r\n      def_rows: [],\r\n      min_height: [],\r\n      min_width: [],\r\n      minGridWidth: 10,\r\n      minGridHeight: 10,\r\n      hResizeable: false,\r\n      vResizeable: false,\r\n      layoutRequired: true\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    this._super(\r\n      extend({stroke: 2}, attr),\r\n      extend({}, setter),\r\n      extend({}, getter))\r\n\r\n    this.resizeListener = function (figure) {\r\n      _this.gridDef.layoutRequired = true\r\n      // propagate the event to the parent or other listener if existing\r\n      //\r\n      if (_this.getParent() instanceof draw2d.shape.layout.Layout) {\r\n        _this.fireEvent(\"resize\")\r\n      }\r\n      // or we are the parent and must consume it self\r\n      else {\r\n        _this.setDimension(\r\n          _this.gridDef.hResizeable === true ?
